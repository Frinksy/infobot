# InfoBot

## Introduction

Infobot is a Spigot plugin / Discord bot that provides a link between a Spigot Minecraft server and a Discord Server.

## Features
- List online players: `/list-players`
- Seamless shared chat between Discord and Minecraft
- Get player stats and display them on discord! Maybe you can have prizes for the top of the scoreboard?
- Get a map showing where players are (tried that, the prototype only shows where grass blocks are on top, adding blocks one by one to the list of blocks seems too painful)
- I am always looking for new ideas! If you have any, feel free to create an issue =)


## Philosophical reasoning that you don't need to read if you just want to install the plugin
I am a Computer Science student. This is a hobby side-project. I used to play a lot of Minecraft. I think that after all this time using other people's mods, texturepacks, resourcepacks maps plugins, I might as well put my skills to use and contribute to the community too.
